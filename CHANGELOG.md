## Changes ðŸŒ½
- Uses the latest DataAttributes (beta.9) & OfflinePlayerCache.
  - The namespace of DataAttributes got changed on this update, breaking the ability to use the mod with the latest one. This has been addressed now.
- This patches an issue when updating modifiers (for I forgot to update PlayerEX when changing namespaces.)
