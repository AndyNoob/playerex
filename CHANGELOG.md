## Fixes ⚒️
- Most if not all values should display properly now, there were incorrect calculations.
- Applied the proper ranged damage to the screen and removed a useless playerex specific ranged attribute.
- Updated AdditionalEntityAttributes
- Resolved values to be what was intended. To use this, delete the previous (data-attributes) config folder.
