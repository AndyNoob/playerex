# PlayerEx
An API mod for Minecraft that expands and improves the attributes system, exposing player attributes through datapacks.

#### Content


The content added by this mod can be summarised in a few bullet points: 

- Exposes all player attributes (defined as entity attributes that apply to the player) through datapacks, allowing for easy modifications such as adding new attributes and/or changing default/base values of attributes.
- Implements a new system for modifying player attribute values: this allows the modification of attribute values to affect other attributes (e.g. adding 1 to constitution could also add 1 to max health).
- Adds a new gui button to the player's survival inventory, which opens a new screen showing all attribute values, including levels, skill points and buttons to level up attributes (a slight RPG theme).
- Provides an API to allow interfacing with the attributes system by other mods.
