#### Game Content

The content added by this mod is split into two distinct categories: 

- In game content, which includes a gui, optional survival HUD and levelling attributes such as maximum health and armour. 
- API system, which includes the expanded attributes system, server-client syncing and development options that allow Modders to add their own attributes, change default attributes and add tooltips.
